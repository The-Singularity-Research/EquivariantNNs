# EquivariantNNs
Equivariant linear maps are fundamental to designing neural networks with equivariant layers. 
This repo will help in constructing the coordinate ring K[Hom(V,W)] = K[Mat(n,m)], of the space 
of linear maps between the vector spaces V and W, with Young tableaux as equivariant monomial 
basis. We have included several references for this construction that may be of help in the 
study of equivariant neural networks.
